# Neural-Network-from-scratch

# Intro
**Project name: Neural Network from scratch (Predicting pass or fail for students)**

I was written this as first project of my Deep Learning course in University of Guilan in Feb 2022.

# Description
This code is about Neural Networks from scratch with 3 different NN that have different number of layers.
It has been trained to predict that the students can pass the course or not.
